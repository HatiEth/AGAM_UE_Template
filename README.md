Project files to create my typical AGAM unreal engine project. 

Folder for assets and Unreal project including a source module.


To use this you download the repository and run 

```
dotnet new --install .\ProjectFiles
```

Then you can create a new UE project setup with running 

```
dotnet new ueproject -o ProjectName
```

Some changes may be needed to made here. Fork if you want to change stuff or just change your local copy. This uses a custom engine association and other stuff :)
